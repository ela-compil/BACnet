This library was originally developed by Morten Kvistgaard with a lot of contributions from F. Chaxel and Steve Karg and the [BACnet Stack (in C)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bacnet/). It is used as a core library in [YABE (Yet Another BACnet Explorer)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yetanotherbacnetexplorer/). It has been forked here from the SourceForge SVN source, splitted into separate repositories and made available to download via NuGet.

## How to use it
